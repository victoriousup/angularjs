					"Logos go by different names -  identity marks, logotypes, and word marks. They all do the same thing, they identify an organization. A good logo will capture a company’s essence in a way that is simple and memorable. Logo designers are often good at drawing. The best ones have the metaphorical sensibilities of a book cover designer combined with the aesthetic sensibilitiesof a packaging designer. That is, they can think of a good simple metaphor or symbol to represent the company and then design it with a high amount of polish.", 
					"Many logo designers work for studios that specialize in branding, while others may be freelancers."

					"The role of a packaging designer is to create appealing packaging for items such as food, beverages, clothes, cosmetics, and toys. He or she will be knowledgable about things like printing processes, paper stock, and die-cuts. They will know when to use four color printing or when spot colors would work better. Successful packaging uses devices such as humor, beauty, and nostalgia to elicit an emotional response response from the consumer. These designers pay special attention to how a package feels to the touch, how much it weighs, and what it smells like. Great packaging is important because it’s often the first interaction a customer has with a product. Food and beverage manufacturers in particular value great packaging because most consumers make purchases while in the store. So the companies appreciate any advantage they can get to capture the attention of shoppers. As a loose rule of thumb, packaging for high-end clients is created by agencies and design firms, and work for commodity products (cereal, flour, milk) is done in-house."

					"A large segment of posters created today are called \"key art\" posters and they're used to promote movies, TV shows, and video games.  Often the style of these posters must match the art direction that’s been established in the film or TV show. For that reason, you don’t have as much creative liberty when designing them. Design driven posters on the other hand, like those shown below allow for more flexibility in what you can do, so they're more fun to make. Sadly in this digital age, it’s hard to make a living by designing only posters. But luckily many of the same concepts and tools used in poster design carry over to other mediums. That’s why many studios who are known for great poster design like Aesthetic Apparatus or The Heads of State, also create packaging, branding, and logos."

					"A good book cover should capture a person's attention at a glance. Unlike packaging design which is similar, a book cover needs a concept to be successful. A concept can evoke a mood or feeling that matches the tone of the book. A cover without a concept won’t compel someone to pick it up. It And that will reflect poorly on the author. The shopper thinks \"if this cover is bad, the book must be bad too\". Book cover designers are also similar to logo designers in that they often use metaphors or symbols in order to hint at the book’s content. This can help illustrate a complex idea in a split-second."

					"Environmental graphics is one part architecture, one part information design, and one part visual design. Instead of moving the eye through the page or screen, the designer moves a body through a space. Environmental graphics can be particularly powerful because it utilizes so many of the senses, like touch, sight, and hearing. This gives the designer many tools to work with to communicate a message. A talented environmental designer will also have an understanding of how humans behave in certain environments, such as in small rooms, in long hallways, or in a group. For that reason it involves elements of sociology and anthropology. Some studios specialize in environmental design, but traditional graphic design studios may take on these projects as well."

					"Motion Graphics is part design, part filmmaking. It uses the principles of design to tell a story over time. Most motion graphics designers get trained in the fundamentals of design first and then learn the specifics of motion graphics later.  In a studio setting, it often takes multiple people (Designer, animator, 3d designer, compositor, sound designer…) to make a commercial motion graphics piece. For this reason, many people specialize in the part of the process they enjoy most. For example designers like Kim Dulaney are great at the initial phase and prefer to come up with the concept, look, and feel of a piece. Whereas someone like Daniel Coutino prefers animating the piece after the details have been worked out."

Some editorial designers enjoy creating an overall system for the pages of a magazine, by creating a grid and telling a story throughout the piece. While others prefer to work on imagery for the cover stories, such as the Zach Galifianakis and Johnny Knoxville covers below. Since editorial designers work under the umbrella of publishing, the salaries for these designers is lower than a logo designer at a branding agency or an interactive designer at a funded startup."

					"This kind of designer loves being great at one thing. Often in school they will beintensely drawn to a particular field and want to do only that. It’s hard to say if you’re meant to be a specialist or a generalist. Indeed, even some specialists who devote themselves to one medium, can grow tired of it years down the road and switch to something else. Often specialists will be freelancers who get called in by ad agencies and design firms for their unique skill. That’s because as a specialist, you may have deeper domain knowledge that the full-time designers at a company, who are more likely to be generalists.", 
					"It may seem unwise to limit yourself to just one speciality. But art directors will often desire you more if you’ve devoted your time to doing just one thing, and it’s the thing they need. If you do only logos, and the other candidate does  logos, branding, websites, and editorial design, it makes you appear to be more proficient in that area."

					"A designer who is a generalist enjoys working in multiple mediums. For the specialist, variety is more important than being great at one thing. Designer’s don’t usually classify themselves as either generalists or specialists in the way programmers do, but it’s still a helpful framework because it will help you figure out what environment you’ll like. The skill level of a generalist in a particular field, is usually less than that of a specialist. For example a designer at an ad agency might spend half the week on motion graphics, but she still probably won’t be as proficient as a full-time motion designer at Buck. That’s ok because, in that case her adaptability is more important than her talent level.", 
					"The decision to become a generalist a usually happens organically. If you find you’re drawn to many different specialties in design, you may be a generalist."

					"An in-house design position is often focuse on one brand. For example if you’re a designer at Toyota, everything you design will be related to the company. Possible projects might entail a new website for an internal project, or working with the marketing department to design their newsletter. Depending on your seniority, you may have regular contact with the creative vendors the company uses. For example a creative director at Toyota could approve work done by their ad agency Saatchi & Saatchi.", 
"Some beginner designers will avoid in-house positions early in their career, so that they can be exposed to multiple clients and working environments. In general, in-house work is seen as slightly less glamorous because many of the cutting edge work will be sourced out to vendors who have expertise in the area of the project. But that’s not always the case. If you’re interviewing for an in-house position, ask what types of projects are done internally, and what get sourced out."

					"A designer at an design firm or ad agency will usually work on multiple brands and you’ll regularly have new projects come across your desk. The types of projects you encounter will depend on your agencies speciality and what you’re good at. If your agency specializes in interactive work, it’s more likely that they’ll hire designers who specialize in that medium. If they take on multiple types projects like <a href='http://sagmeisterwalsh.com' target='_blank' class='clink'>http://sagmeisterwalsh.com</a>, it’s more likely you’ll be a generalist who can handle different types of projects.", 
					"For designers just starting their career, getting exposed to multiple projects at an agency can be beneficial. You’ll get a sense of what it takes to create in that medium in a professional setting. Agency life can require long hours so it’s not for everyone. For that reason some people start at agencies for the first part of their career, then move on to an in-house position later."
